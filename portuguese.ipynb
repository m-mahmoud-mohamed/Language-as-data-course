    "### Summary of BPE Tokenization Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **BPE Tokens per Custom Word Token:**\n",
    "   - **Mean: 1.20** tokens - BPE slightly over-segments compared to our custom morphological tokenizer\n",
    "   - **Median: 1.00** - Most custom tokens map to exactly one BPE token\n",
    "   - \n",
    "Median: 1.00\n",
    "Min: 1\n",
    "Max: 13\n",
    "Std dev: 0.64\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Morpheme Segmentation Patterns:**\n",
    "   - **✅ Consistent:** Masculine plural markers (ون/ين) reliably segmented (e.g., معلمون → معلم + ون)\n",
    "   - **⚠️ Inconsistent:** Definite article (ال) and feminine plural (ات) show variable segmentation\n",
    "   - **❌ Problematic:** Combined affixes (والمعلم) often merged into single tokens\n",
    "   - **Root Cause:** BPE learns frequency-based patterns, not grammatical rules. High-frequency words memorized as units; rare words over-segmented.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Word Category Comparison:**\n",
    "   - **Frequent words:** Lower BPE tokens/word (learned as vocabulary items)\n",
    "   - **Infrequent words:** Higher segmentation (decomposed into subword units)\n",
    "   - **Unseen words:** Highest segmentation (no memorization, pure subword splitting)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** While BPE captures some Arabic morphological patterns, its statistical approach produces inconsistent affix handling compared to rule-based morphological tokenization. The mean of 1.34 suggests reasonable vocabulary efficiency, though a morphologically-aware pre-tokenizer could improve consistency."
